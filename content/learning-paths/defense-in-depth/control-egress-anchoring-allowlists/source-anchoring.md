Engaging in Source IP Anchoring has been an increasingly common practice in the past 10 years as businesses began to shift more traffic out of their office perimeter, but still relied on their corporate IPs as a primary "source of truth" for 'trusted egress'. Cloudflare understands the relevance of that model, and offers a number of similar concepts that can help businesses transition away from a reliance on static IP egress and its challenges due to its subsequent backhauling and often single-threaded points of failure. The next section will discuss best practices for migrating from managing backhauled user traffic in the context of IP allow-listing to delivering consistent security practices and IP consistency without sacrificing performance.
