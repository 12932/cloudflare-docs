- [Configure the App Launcher](/cloudflare-one/applications/app-launcher/#docs-content) so that users can open all applications from single dashboard.
- [Add bookmarks](/cloudflare-one/applications/bookmarks/) to the App Launcher for applications that are not behind Access.
- [Customize the login page](/cloudflare-one/applications/custom-pages/#login-page) with your organization's branding.
- [Display custom block pages](/cloudflare-one/applications/custom-pages/#block-page) when a user is blocked by your Access policies.
