Cloudflare Tunnel connects applications and services to Cloudflareâ€™s network. Cloudflare Tunnel is an outbound-only daemon service that can run on nearly any host machine and proxies local traffic once validated from the Cloudflare network.

## Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Create a Cloudflare Tunnel
- Understand private network routes for your Tunnel
- Deploy your first Zero Trust policies to secure access to your internal network
