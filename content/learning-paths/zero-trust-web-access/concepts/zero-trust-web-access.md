Zero Trust Web Access (ZTWA), also known as Zero Trust Application Access (ZTAA), applies Zero Trust principles to provide users with secure access to internal applications. ZTWA verifies user access to applications by integrating with [identity providers](/learning/access-management/what-is-an-identity-provider/), encrypting connections, considering each access request for an application individually, and blocking or allowing on a request-by-request basis.

## ZTNA vs. ZTWA

Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and Zero Trust Web Access (ZTWA) are complementary solutions for providing secure remote access to internal resources.

ZTNA focuses on granting access to private networks. ZTNA implementations usually involve installing device client software in order to provide access to non-HTTP resources and filter all user traffic.

ZTWA, on the other hand, focuses on granting access to specific applications on the network. ZTWA can be delivered without a device client for internal web applications that are accessed in a browser. Clientless deployments allow organizations to quickly onboard users to their applications, especially users on unmanaged devices such as third-party contractors or vendors.
