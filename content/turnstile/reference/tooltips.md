# Tooltips

## Top Actions

Top Actions allow you to add a label for your actions.

Action can be used in analytics and is more limited in size. It should identify different pages in a website where a widget is used.

Action should not contain any personally identifiable information (PII) as this is placed into the analytics.

cData is not stored in our analytics. It can contain data that may vary by each challenge instance.

Both cData and action are returned by the siteverify API if a valid token is presented.
